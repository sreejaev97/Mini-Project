This is my first mini project on Data Analytics .The goal of my project was to analyze retail sales and customer satisfaction data to find insights that could help improve overall performance and customer experience.I used Excel for initial data cleaning and exploration, and then used Power BI to build interactive dashboards and deeper analysis.
Data Collection & Cleaning:
I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats in Excel.
Data Analysis:
I analyzed key metrics like total sales, net amount,  product category performance, customer feedback scores, and satisfaction trends over time
Visualization & Reporting:
Using Power BI, I created dynamic dashboards showing sales performance by region,  product, time period, and customer satisfaction ratings. I also added slicers and filters to make it easy to drill down into specific details.
